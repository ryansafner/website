abstract: This paper models the relationship between innovation and sustained economic growth through as being mediated by institutions that calibrate a "structure of technological production" analogous to capital-based models of the structure of production. Our framework discusses two types of capital: physical capital and ethereal capital (productivity-enhancing ideas). We cast these two structures in a network, the structure of which is determined by the institutions of a society. Predictions derived from this model may resolve some puzzles in the history of economic growth, such as ancient inventions :far ahead of their time" failing to stimulate sustained growth, the phenomena of simultaneous independent invention, and failures of technology transfers.
