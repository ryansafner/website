title: Test Post Please Don't Ignore
---

With the new school year in full swing, I have redesigned my personal website, and plan to make occasional posts on the tools I use in my research and teaching. Over the summer, I made the full conversion to using *R*, *R Markdown*, and *Github* for nearly everything I do in my professional life (including managing my website with [Hugo/Academic](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/)). 

This semester, I am teaching econometrics to my students using *R* for the first time, and optionally nudging them to use *R Markdown* for their homeworks and paper assignment. My training, both in undergraduate and graduate school, was with Stata, so I am particularly excited to shake things up a bit. 

I primarily see this blog as the venue to occasionally post about my experiences and as well as tutorials in using these tools for research and teaching. I have benefited enormously in the past year from reading syllabi, lecture slides, and blog posts from many academics that I have never met, but were kind enough to make their materials public on their websites and on Github. Among others, the materials of [Jenny Bryan](http://stat545.com/), [Hadley Wickham](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/), [Yihue Xie](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/), [Jake Russ](jakeruss.com/cheatsheets/stargazer), and [J. Alexander Branham](https://github.com/jabranham/) have proved most helpful. 

I hope to do my small part to spread word about these useful tools and post examples I use in class or in my research here.
