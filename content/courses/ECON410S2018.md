> What's so great about democracy other than it's democratic? - Gordon Tullock

Modern democratic governments directly control more than $\frac{1}{3}$ of gross national product and strongly influence the remaining $\frac{2}{3}$ through various fiscal and regulatory policies. How does "the government" make decisions, enforce laws, and provide the goods and services it is expected to? How does it interact with, and affect, the rest of the economy? A major part of this course is exploding the black box that we call "goverment" to examine and model the different political actors: voters, politicians, bureaucrats, & interest groups, and how they interact with one another to produce public policy and achieve their separate goals. 

The major analytic framework used in this course is commonly known as "public choice:" the application of economic modeling (optimization and equilibrium) to study non-market decision-making. Markets use prices and voluntary exchanges to allocate scarce goods among competing uses based on individual preferences. Many other aspects of modern life do *not* rely on prices or voluntary exchanges; the primary arena we explore is *politics* - the realm of collective decision-making where a single choice is made for *everyone*. A simple summary of what we will be doing in this course is expanding and exploring answers to the question: **how do we choose in groups?**

Our primary focus will be the government of a modern liberal democracy, particularly the United States since 1789. In many ways, this is a more rigorous complement to your classic high school or college Civics course, but you will soon discover, it will at times emphasize key civic virtues of American governance, and at other times gore sacred cows and contradict popular myths. Time permitting, the end of the course will examine and compare other political systems such as autocracy, as well as other forms of non-market decision-making like law and religion.
