<!-- This part is below the two columns --> 

I am an Associate Professor of Economics at [Hood College](https://www.hood.edu/academics/Economics-and-Management/index.html). I have a Ph.D and M.A. in Economics from [George Mason University](http://economics.gmu.edu/), and a B.A. in Economics from the [University of Connecticut](http://economics.uconn.edu/). Go Huskies!

My research broadly explores the political economy of innovation, technological growth, and intellectual property using the tools of [new institutional economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutional_economics), [public choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice), and [market process economics](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/AustrianSchoolofEconomics.html). I blog about these issues at [Increasing Returns](https://increasingreturns.substack.com).

I regularly teach Microeconomic Analysis and Econometrics, rotating through economics electives such as Game Theory, International Trade, and Economics of  Developments. I am a firm believer of providing public goods and promoting open source materials, so you can find all course materials on my [course websites](teaching.qmd).

I am a passionate user of [*R*](https://www.r-project.org/) for data analysis, and [*R Markdown*](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for writing reproducible research, version control, and managing my workflow. I blog [here](/blog.html) about using these tools in my research and teaching, and learning new tools "out loud".
