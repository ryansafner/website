:::{#hero-heading} 

I am an Economist at the Office of the Chief Economist at the [U.S. Copyright Office](https://copyright.gov/economic-research).

Previously, I was Associate Professor of Economics at [Hood College](https://www.hood.edu/academics/departments/george-b-delaplaine-jr-school-business), and I have taught 17 different economics courses over the last 10 years. I am a firm believer of providing public goods & promoting open source materials, so you can find all course materials on my custom [course websites](teaching.qmd).
 
My personal research explores the political economy of innovation, technological growth, and intellectual property using the tools of [new institutional economics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_institutional_economics), [public choice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_choice), and [market process economics](http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/AustrianSchoolofEconomics.html). I write about these issues in a non-technical way at my Substack, [Safnerism](https://ryansafner.substack.com).

I am a passionate user of [*R*](https://www.r-project.org/) for data analysis, and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for writing reproducible research, using version control, and managing my workflow. I keep a repository of information and tips about using these tools, as well as write about data science and economics at [safneR scripts](https://safnerscripts.substack.com).
