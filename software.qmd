This page is under construction, but most of my projects are open source and can be found in my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/ryansafner). This includes all of the materials for my [course websites](https://ryansafner.com/teaching) and course content.

## Shiny Portfolio

These are largely [R shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps that I have written to demonstrate economic concepts for my economics courses. The main purpose is to visualize concepts in action (often through a graph) and especially show how key parameters affect the outcome by allowing users to change these values and see the graph update dynamically.

## Economics Graphs in `ggplot`

I have taught a variety of economics courses and make all of my slides and course materials in R/Xaringan/Quarto. This includes a wide variety of graphs of economic concepts, all of which I have drawn in `ggplot2`. I will begin creating a library of different graphs and the source code to make them.

## Course Websites

Since the Fall of 2019, I have made individualized websites for each of my courses. You can find links to them on my [teaching page](https://ryansafner.com/teaching), and the repositories on [my GitHub](https://github.com/ryansafner).

## Hex Stickers

As part of my themeing for each of my courses, I have been making a custom hex stickers in the style that has become popular in the R/tidyverse community. You can find the image sources, outputs, and the code to render each one in [this repository](https://github.com/ryansafner/hexstickers).
