Hayek, 1974 Economics Nobel Laureate\n\nThe goal of this course is to introduce you to the economic way of thinking and to demonstrate its power in comprehending the world around us. This class assumes you have no knowledge of economics whatsoever, and I teach it like it is the first, and last, economics class you will ever take. I hope it will not be.\nSo what is economics? Most people, upon hearing the words “economics” or “economist” imagine some combination of money, business, and those folks on the news who report “the latest numbers” on the economy (which always seem to be different than previous forecasts). These examples certainly might use economics, but economics really is a much broader way of thinking, analyzing, and understanding the world around us. With economics, you will learn to appreciate the role of prices, incentives, and institutions in fostering cooperation and social order to achieve all of the things (material and nonmaterial) that we desire from the human experience.\nThis course will have been successful if you are able to apply the economic way of thinking to your own passions, future studies, and professional aspirations that involve social, political, and economic issues. Understanding basic economics will also make you a better citizen in our democratic and market-based society. I invite you to diligently grapple with the ideas raised in our readings and discussions, and to do all that you can to try to understand and explore the world around you. More specifically, I aim for you to be able to:\n\nEffectively understand, articulate, and critique economic arguments verbally and in writing\nApply economic tools and theories to market conditions, including using appropriate graphical and mathematical tools.\nObtain basic understanding of economic statistics, as well as know where to collect them and how to effectively present them graphically and numerically.\nUnderstand current policy debates and formulate informed opinions"

    "text": "I am originally from Connecticut, I got my bachelor’s in Economics at UConn and my Ph.D in Economics at George Mason University in 2015. Between graduate school and my family’s careers, I have lived in 5 states (if you include the District of Columbia) and I currently live in Takoma Park, MD with my wife and kid.\nI’m a big fan of Miami Hurricanes college football (my wife’s undergrad alma mater) and UConn Huskies basketball. In my spare time, I enjoy running, cycling, reading, eating (and trying to cook) good (mostly vegetarian) food, traveling, and enjoying lots of live music with my wife.\nAs an economist, I am interested in understanding what institutions and policies best allow us to come up with inventions and ideas that benefit everyone. This has led me down rabbit holes ranging from 17th century English institutional change, to 19th century American literary piracy, to the success of Wikipedia, to crowdfunding, blockchains, & generative AI. Aspirationally, I am trying to expand my research and software skill horizons into more computational social science themes with agent-based modeling. You can find more about my research interests from a high-level, non-technical perspective at Increasing Returns.\nI consider myself a lifelong educator (& humble student) of economics and social science. Most of my post-graduate life was focused on the conveyor belt of academia, ultimately earning tenure at Hood College in 2022. Despite this achievement (or perhaps because of it), I decided I needed a change in perspective and wanted to experience life outside the ivory tower while still learning, researching, and contributing to the public good. Despite no longer being in the classroom with students (which I miss), I still enjoy keeping up with the scholarly literature (my wife tells me I read too much non-fiction) and writing about economic issues well beyond my day job.\nI am also an amateur tech nerd. With no formal training in computer science or software engineering, I have put disproportionate time into learning and practicing open source data science software. I enjoy tinkering around in R and producing useful visualizations and simulations, many of which I have posted on my software page. Except when absolutely required in my current job, I have not touched Microsoft Office since 2011, I write all of my research papers, teaching materials, even this website, in R and markdown (which I fully explain in my econometrics course). I very occasionally blog about these tools here.\nI enjoy meeting new people with different interests and backgrounds, so feel free to reach out to me by email or on LinkedIn!"

Businesses, governments, academics, nonprofit organizations, consultants, and many other professions are using more data than ever. The rise of the internet and the ability for organizations to track many things about their users, known as “big data,” make statistical literacy and competency one of the most in-demand skills that most employers today are looking for.\nThis course is designed as an introduction to data and how it is collected, described, and used to make useful inferences about the world. I am an economist, not a business expert nor a mathematician. While we will be dealing with elementary statistical and probability theory, we will be keeping our eye towards applications in business and economics. If you want a more ``pure” class in statistics or mathematics, they are offered by the department of mathematics. The formal prerequisites for this course are MATH 120 or equivalent. I assume that you have no background in statistics or probability (we will start from square one), but that you are competent in basic algebra and graphing skills (we may do a brief review as necessary).\nI have three goals for everyone taking this course: (1) to understand and evaluate statistical and empirical claims; (2) to understand research design and hypothesis testing; (3) to gain experience working with, interpreting, and communicating real data. I am less concerned with forcing you to memorize and recite proofs of statistical estimator properties, and more concerned with the development of your intuitions and the ability to think critically as a businessperson, a social scientist, and a democratic citizen—although this will require you to demonstrate proficiency with some statistical and mathematical tools.\nTo these ends, in addition to lectures about statistical methods, you will be working on problem sets that use theory, as well as using Microsoft Excel to complete problem sets using data, and write a brief empirical paper using data. By the end, you should feel comfortable working with data and understanding the empirical claims of others. The best training is for you to learn by doing."

Hayek, 1974 Economics Nobel Laureate\n\nThis course examines the dual role of political institutions and economic forces that determine the relative prosperity, conflict, and/or flourishing of human beings in different social settings. As political economy–the enduring tradition that Adam Smith and others developed before technical “economics” emerged in the 20th century–it deals with some of the moral and institutional problems that societies must grapple with, and why some succeed or fail more relative to others. While we consider the theory of various political and economic institutions, we often apply them to an international context of trade, globalization, foreign aid, conflict, development in our increasingly global-oriented cultures. As a result, a major goal of this course is understanding the state of the world and current events today, as well as being able to reason through political economic problems.\nThis is an economics course, and as such we use the tools of microeconomics to understand not just economic, but also political, social, and cultural issues. Basic familiarity with microeconomics is essential to understanding how decisions made by agents in different institutional contexts lead to social coordination and the creation of value (or fail to do so). While I would prefer that you have some background, it is possible to take the course with little to no understanding of formal economic theory. The required prerequisite courses are ECON 205, PCSI 215, OR GLBS 200.\nThis course will have been successful if you are able to comprehend and apply the tools and insights of political economy towards explaining differences in real world political, economic, and cultural settings and are able to analyze current events. Primarily, this means applying models of rational choices for individual and firm behavior in different social contexts, and understanding the role of market institutions of property rights, prices, and profit and losses in bringing about social coordination."
